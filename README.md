# Phase-field-Method
Based on the finite difference method (FDM), the coupling of phase-field evolution and solute diffusion was achieved, using the anisotropic Allen-Cahn equation, for the evolution of alloy dendrites at the mesoscale

The code is still being integrated for the release version.
The code will be released soon after optimization.If any friends urgently need the code, they can contact me: 2300837983@qq.com
